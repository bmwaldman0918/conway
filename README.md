# Conway
### Pixeled
The pixeled contains 2D arrays that represent digits so that they can be displayed in pixelated form by the grid class.  
### Grid
The grid class allows simulation of Conway's game of life on a grid of tiles. By default, the grid is populated with tiles that form a pixelated version of today's date.
